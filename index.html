            <p>Born and raised in Colombia. Happily married for about 20 years.  I met my husband when he was working on the World Trade Center.  He was suppose to help me get a job but instead he married me!</p>
            <p>I have worked for more than 14 years in a financial institution and I enjoy what i do.</p>
            <p>A few years ago, Oh Ok!!, many years ago, I did complete a 2 year degree at the Kingsborough Community College where  I was introduced to coding.  I have to say that I felt in love with Visual Basics</p>
            <p>From time to time, I have the opportunity to create a little code in Excel to make my work easier but would love to lear more.</p>
            <p>I do love to travel, especially to Florida but I don't enjoy flying much.  This is why I love taking the auto train down in Washington, D.C..  This train take us all the way to Sandford, FL which is then 30 minutes to my parent's house</p>
